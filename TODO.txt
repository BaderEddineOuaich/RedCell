- Footer DONE
- Header DONE
- About 
- Login DONE
- Register DONE
- Profile DONE
- Chercher  Pagination & ( where disponible="oui" ) and maybe where session.id_donneur != id_donneur
- ViewDonor DONE
- Accueil DONE index (maybe show cards of each city or region and how many available donors there, and total donors available now)
- Contact US NOT NEEDED (maybe table ContactMessages id fullname message email )


advantages in using Region & Ville tables are: we'l have to deal with ids instead of values who may have special characters due french language..
